40 THE ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO

And he remained irresolute. It was, however, necessary
to come to a decision. Should he go to school? or should he
go after the fifes?

“Today I will go and hear the fifes, and tomorrow I
will go to school,” finally decided the young scapegrace, shrug-
ging his shoulders.

The more he ran the nearer came the sounds of the
fifes and the beating of the big drum: Fi-fi-fi; zum, zum,
zum, zum.

At last he found himself in the middle of a square quite
full of people, who were all crowded round a building made
of wood and canvas, and painted a thousand colors.

“What is that building?” asked Pinocchio, turning to a
little boy who belonged to the place.

“Read the placard—it is all written—and then you will
know.”

“I would read it willingly, but it so happens that today
I don’t know how to read.”

“Bravo, blockhead! Then I will read it to you. The writ-
ing on that placard in those letters red as fire is:

“Tue Great Puppet THEATER.”

“Has the play begun long?”

“It is beginning now.”

“How much does it cost to go in?”

“A dime.”

Pinocchio, who was in a fever of curiosity, lost all control
of himself, and without any shame he said to the little boy
to whom he was talking:

“Would you lend me a dime until tomorrow?”

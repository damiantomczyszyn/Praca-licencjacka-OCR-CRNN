The sacristan began for the first time to show signs of hurry and
impatience. He heaved a sigh of relief when camera and note-book
were finally packed up and stowed away, and hurriedly beckoned
Dennistoun to the western door of the church, under the tower. It was
time to ring the Angelus. A few pulls at the reluctant rope, and the
great bell Bertrande, high in the tower, began to speak, and swung her
voice up among the pines and down to the valleys, loud with
mountain-streams, calling the dwellers on those lonely hills to
remember and repeat the salutation of the angel to her whom he called
Blessed among women. With that a profound quiet seemed to fall for
the first time that day upon the little town, and Dennistoun and the
sacristan went out of the church.

On the doorstep they fell into conversation.

'Monsieur seemed to interest himself in the old choir-books in the
sacristy.'

'Undoubtedly. I was going to ask you if there were a library in the
town.'

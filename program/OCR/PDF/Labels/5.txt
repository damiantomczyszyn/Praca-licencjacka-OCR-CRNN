strangulare. (How St Bertrand delivered a man whom the Devil long
sought to strangle.)

Dennistoun was turning to the sacristan with a smile and a jocular
remark of some sort on his lips, but he was confounded to see the old
man on his knees, gazing at the picture with the eye of a suppliant in
agony, his hands tightly clasped, and a rain of tears on his cheeks.
Dennistoun naturally pretended to have noticed nothing, but the
question would not go away from him,'Why should a daub of this kind
affect anyone so strongly?' He seemed to himself to be getting some
sort of clue to the reason of the strange look that had been puzzling
him all the day: the man must be a monomaniac; but what was his
monomania?

It was nearly five o'clock; the short day was drawing in, and the
church began to fill with shadows, while the curious noises--the
muffled footfalls and distant talking voices that had been perceptible
all day--seemed, no doubt because of the fading light and the
consequently quickened sense of hearing, to become more frequent
and insistent.

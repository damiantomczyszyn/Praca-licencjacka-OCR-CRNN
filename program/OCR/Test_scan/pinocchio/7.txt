	"But to go to school I shall want some clothes."

	Geppetto, who was poor and who had not so much as a
penny in his pocket, then made him a little dress of flowered
paper, a pair of shoes from the bark of a tree, and a cap
of the crumb of bread.

	Pinocchio ran immediately to look at himself in a crock
of water, and he was so pleased with his appearance that he
said, strutting about like a peacock:

	"I look quite like a gentleman!"

	"Yes, indeed," answered Geppetto, "for bear in mind
that it is not fine clothes that make the gentleman, but rather
clean clothes."

	At that moment out came the showman. He was very
big, and so ugly that the sight of him was enough to frighten
anyone. His beard was as black as ink, and so long that it
reached from his chin to the ground. I need only say that
he trod upon it when he walked. His mouth was as big as
an oven, and his eyes were like two lanterns of red glass with
lights burning inside them. He carried a large whip made of
snakes and foxes' tails twisted together, which he cracked
constantly.
	At his unexpected appearance there was a profound silence:
no one dared to breathe. A fly might have been heard in the
stillness. The poor puppets of both sexes trembled like so
many leaves.
	"Why have you come to raise a disturbance in my theater?"
asked the showman of Pinocchio, in the gruff voice of a hob-
goblin suffering from a severe cold in the head.
	"Believe me, honored sir, it was not my fault!"

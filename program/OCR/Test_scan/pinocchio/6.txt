No sooner had the puppet satisfied his hunger than he began
to cry and to grumble because he wanted a pair of
new feet.

	But Geppetto, to punish him for his naughtiness, allowed
him to cry and to despair for half the day. He then said
to him:

	"Why should I make you new feet? To enable you,
perhaps, to escape again from home?"

	"I promise you," said the puppet, sobbing, "that for the
future I will be good."

	"All boys," replied Geppetto, "when they are bent upon
obtaining something, say the same thing."

	Geppetto, who from all this jumbled account had only
understood one thing, which was that the puppet was dying
of hunger, drew from his pocket three pears and, giving them
to him, said:
	"These three pears were intended for my breakfast, but
I will give them to you willingly. Eat them, and I hope
they will do you good."
	"If you wish me to eat them, be kind enough to peel
them for me."
	"Peel them?" said Geppetto, astonished. "I should never
have thought, my boy, that you were so dainty and fastidious.
That is bad! In this world we should accustom ourselves
from childhood to like and to eat everything, for there is no
saying to what we may be brought. There are so many
chances!"

	"That will bring somebody."
	And so it did. A little old man appeared at a window
with a night-cap on his head and called to him angrily:
	"What do you want at such an hour?"
	"Would you be kind enough to give me a little bread?"
	"Wait there, I will be back directly," said the little old
man, thinking it was one of those rascally boys who amuse
themselves at night by ringing the house-bells to rouse re-
spectable people who are sleeping quietly.
	After half a minute the window was again opened and the
voice of the same little old man shouted to Pinocchio:
	"Come underneath and hold out your cap."
	Pinocchio pulled off his cap; but, just as he held it out,
an enormous basin of water was poured down on him, soak-
ing him from head to foot as if he had been a pot of dried-up
geraniums.

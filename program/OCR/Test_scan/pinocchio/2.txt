	And the noise he made in falling was as if a sack of 
wooden ladles had been thrown from a fifth story.
	"Open the door!" shouted Geppetto from the street.
	"Dear papa, I cannot," answered the puppet, crying 
and rolling about on the ground.
	"Why can't you?"
	"Because my feet have been eaten."
	"And who has eaten your feet?"
	"The cat," said Pinocchio, seeing the cat, who was amus-
ing herself by making some shavings dance with her forepaws.
	"Open the door, I tell you!" repeated Geppetto. "If 
you don't, when I get into the house you shall have the cat 
from me!"
	"I cannot stand up, believe me. Oh, poor me! poor me!
I shall have to walk on my knees for the rest of my life!"

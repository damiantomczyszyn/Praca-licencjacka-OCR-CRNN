That will bring somebody
i and so it did
i a little old man appeared at a window
with a nightcap on his head and called to him angrily
orwhat do you want at such in hours
would you be kind enough to give me a little breeds
wait there 1 will be back directly said the little old
man thinking it was one of those rascally boys who amuse
themselves at night by ringing the house. Bells to rouse real
spectacle people who are sleeping quietly
after helfsminute the window was again opened and the
voice of the same little old man shouted to pinocchio
become underneath and hold out your cap i i
pinocchio pulled off his each but just as he held to out
an enormous basin of water was poured down on him socks
ing him from head to foot as if he had been spot of dried. Up
geraniums
and the noise he made in falling was as if a sack of
wooden ladles had been thrown from a fifth story
open the doors shouted geppetto from the street
dear papa 1 cannot, ss answered the puppet crying
i and rolling about on the ground
why cant yours
because my feet have been extends i i
i cand who has eaten your feet's
seethe cats said pinocchio seeing the cat who was amuse
ing herself be making some shavings dance with her foreoaws.
Reopen the door i tell vous repeated geppetto. If
you dont when i get into the house you shall have the cat
i from mefor
ri cannot stand up believe me oh poor met poor me
i shall have to walk on my knees for the rest of my heir i
geppetto, believing that all this lamentation was only
another of the puppets tricks thought ofa means of putting
anendtoit, and, climbing up the wall he goint the window
he was very angry and at first he did nothing but scold
but when he saw his pinocchio lying on the ground and really
without feet he was quite overcome he took him in his arms
and began to kiss and caress him and to say a thousand
endearing things to him and as the big tears ran down his
i cheeks he said sobbing
emy little pinocchio how did vou manage to burn vour
i feet's
it dont1know, papa, but it has been such a dreadful night
that i shall remember it as long as i live it thundered
butt don? T1know, papa, but it has been such a dreadful night
that i shall remember it as long as i live
i it thundered
and lightened and i was very hungry and then the talking
cricket said to me
i it serves you right you have been
wicked and you deserve it and i said to him take care
cricket and he said you are a puppet and you have a
wooden head and i threw the handle of a hammer at him
and he died but the fault was his for 1 didnt wish to kill
him and the proof of it is that i put an earthenware saucer
on a brazier of burning embers but a chicken new out and
said adieu until we meet again and many compliments to
all at home and i got still more hungry for which reason
that little old man in a nightcap opening the window said
to me come underneath and hold out your hate and poured
a painful of water on my head because asking for a little
i
bread isnt disgrace is it and i returned home at once and
geppetto, who from all this jumbled account had only
understood one thing which was that the puppet was dying
i
of hunger drew fromhispoeket three pesrsand, giving them
to him said
these three pears were intended for my breakfast but
i 1 will give them to you willingly i
i eat them and i hope
they will do you good. ? ?
Scif you wish me to eat them be kind enough to peel
them for me. ? ?
Peel them? Vv said geppetto, astonished eri should never
have thought my boy that you were so dainty and fastidious
that is bad in this world we should accustom ourselves
from childhood to like and to eat everything for there is no
saying to what we my be brought
i there are so many
i chances
sooner cry had tlsbait2alhkg,. A he,. Kegan i
i new feet
but geppetto, to punish him for his naughtiness allowed
him to cry and to despair for half the day
i he then said
to him
, cwhv should 1 make you new feet to enable you
i perhaps to escape again from homes
ceci promise youto said the puppet sobbing that for the
i future 1 will be good. Vv
squall boys, vv replied geppetto, .4ttwhen they are bent upon
i obtaining something say the same thing. ? V
abut to go to school 1 shall want some clothes. Ss
geppetto, who was poor and who had not so much as a
penny in his pocket then made hima little dress of flowered
paper a pair of shoes from the bark of a tree and a cop
i of the crumb of bread
pinocchio ran immediately to look it himself in a crock
of water and he wasso pleased with his sppesrsnce that he
said strutting about like a peacock
qui look quite like a gentleman's
eyes indeed, ag answered geppetto, for bear in mind
i
that it is not fne clothes that make the gentleman but rather
i clean clothes. ? V
all ast once harlequin stopped short and turning to the
public he pointed with his hand to some one far down in
the pit and exclaimed in a dramatic tone
gods of the firmament do i dream or so i asked
but surely that is pinocchio
i ait is indeed pinocchio's cried punch
quits indeed himselfin screamed miss rose peeping from
behind the scenes
tit is pinocchio it is pinocchio's shouted all the puppets
in chorus keeping from all sides on to the stage it is
pinocchio it sour brother pinocchio long livepinocchiop
pinocchio come up here to leave cried harlequin and
throw yourself into the arms of your wooden brothers
at this affectionate invitation pinocchio made a less from
the end of the pit into the reserved tests another less landed
him on the head of the leader of the orchestra and he then
sprang upon the stage
the embraces the friendly pinches and the demonstrate
tions of warm brotherly affection that pinocchio received from
the excited crowd of actors and actresses of the puppet draw
matic company are beyond description
i
the sight was doubtless a moving one but the public in
the pity finding that the play was stopped become impatient
and began i to shout butwe will have the play... Go on with
the playin
to was all breath thrown sway the puppets instead of
continuing the recital redoubled their noise and outcries and
putting pinocchio on their shoulders they carried him in trip
ump before the footlights
at that moment out came the showman
i he was very
big and so ugly that the sight of him was enough to frighten
i his beard was as black as ink and so long that it
anyone
reached from his chin to the ground
i i need only say that
he trod upon it when he walked his mouth was is big is
an oven and his eves were like two lanterns of red glass with
lights burning inside them he carried a large whip made of
snakes and foxes tails twisted together which he cracked
ea, erqstantly.
. Athsuoexpectel1appearxns there was. A. Profound. Silence.
No one dared to breathe a fly might have been heard in the
stillness
the poor puppets of both sexes trembled like so
i
many leaves
why hsveyoucome to. Raises. Disturbsnce in my theaters
asked the showman of pinocchio in the gruff voice of a hobby
goblin suffering from a severe cold in the head
believe me honored girl it was not my fsulti,
